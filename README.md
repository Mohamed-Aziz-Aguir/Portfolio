## SEO, Social Preview & Analytics

### Meta / OG
- Title: **Mohamed Aziz Aguir — Cybersecurity Engineer (Blue & Red Teaming)**
- Description: *Mohamed Aziz Aguir — Cybersecurity Engineer focusing on SOC engineering, CTI, security automation, and both blue & red teaming. Based in Monastir, Tunisia.*
- Open Graph image: `/public/og-image.png` (created)

The site includes basic meta and Open Graph tags in `src/pages/index.js`. Update them as needed.

### Analytics options
- **Vercel Analytics**: enable it in the Vercel dashboard for your project — no code changes required.
- **Plausible**: if you prefer Plausible, replace `your-domain.com` in the script tag added as a comment in the Head of `src/pages/index.js` and enable the script.

### Badges / Certifications
- A placeholder grid exists on the home page. When you have TryHackMe badges, add images to `public/badges/` and link them from `src/pages/index.js` or enhance the badges component.

### Red Team Lab
- A starter page is included at `/projects/red-team-lab` with a lab outline (Recon → Initial Access → PrivEsc → Post-Exploitation → Detection notes → Reports). Use it to document exercises and attach artifacts.
